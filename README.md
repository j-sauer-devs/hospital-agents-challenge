# Multi-Agent Hospital System with Vertex AI Search & ADK

This project is a modular, multi-agent ecosystem built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Vertex AI Search. It transforms a standard RAG prototype into a coordinated team of specialized agents designed to handle clinical, administrative, and research tasks within a hospital environment.

## Architecture Overview

The system transitions from a single chatbot to a hierarchy of specialized personas:

*   **The Doctor Agent:** A clinical resident specialist. It uses RAG to reason over private medical records and provide grounded, cited answers.
*   **The Receptionist Agent:** An administrative specialist. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage appointment scheduling and check availability.
*   **The Researcher Agent:** An academic explorer. It synthesizes local patient data with global medical research using Google Search and multi-agent synthesis.
*   **The Orchestrator Agent:** The system's triage specialist. It analyzes user intent and delegates tasks to the appropriate sub-agent using Agent-as-a-Tool (A2A) integration.
*   **The Emergency Agent:** A crisis management specialist. It interacts with a live hospital simulation (via an MCP server) to triage patients and allocate critical resources during emergencies.

## How It Works

The application operates in two primary modes:

1.  **Ingestion (`--mode ingest`):** Processes unstructured documents (PDFs) from `data/raw/`, parses them, and indexes them into a Vertex AI Search data store for use by the Doctor and Researcher agents.
2.  **Chat (`--mode chat`):** Launches an interactive CLI. You can now specify which agent you want to converse with using the `--agent` flag.

## Key Commands

### Setup
-   `make install`: Installs all project dependencies using Poetry.
-   `make infra`: Provisions required GCP infrastructure (Data Store, Engine, GCS Buckets).

### Running the Application
- **Ingest Data:**
    ```bash
    poetry run python main.py --mode ingest
    ```
- **Chat via Web UI (Recommended):**
    This launches a local web-based playground where you can select between different agents (Doctor, Receptionist, etc.) and view tool calls in real-time.
    ```bash
    poetry run adk web src/agents
    ```
- **Chat via CLI:**
    ```bash
    # Chat with the Doctor (Default)
    poetry run python main.py --mode chat --agent doctor

    # Chat with the Receptionist
    poetry run python main.py --mode chat --agent receptionist
    ```
